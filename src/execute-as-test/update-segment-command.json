Of course not all sacrifices are equal. Those you make for personal gain, like working overtime to pay for a vacation, hold less meaning than those you make for the greater good, like volunteering on a Saturday.\n\nEven though it might feel like it when you do it, sacrifice is never really about giving up rewards. It's about deferring them until you can get something even better, usually a feeling of whole-ness or contentment. As such, it's also great willpower training.\n\nHere's an analogy Peterson makes.
